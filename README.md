# GraphQL API Repository

Welcome to the GraphQL API repository! This repository contains the codebase for a GraphQL API built using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) technology. This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and other relevant details.

## Overview

Briefly describe the purpose and scope of your GraphQL API. What problem does it solve? What features does it offer? Provide a high-level overview to help users understand the project's goals.

## Project Structure

Explain the organization of the project's codebase. Describe the directory structure, key files, and any important modules or components. This section helps users navigate the repository and understand where to find specific functionality.


## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YashXBansal/GraphQL.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GRAPHQL`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can start the GraphQL server using the following command:
`npm start`

The GraphQL server will be running at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`. You can open this URL in your web browser or use tools like Postman or GraphQL Playground to interact with the API.
